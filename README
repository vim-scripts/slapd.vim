Syntax highlighting for OpenLDAP configuration file. This syntax supports databases and daemon configuration, tree access directives and schema definition, that is, most of the things required in OpenLDAP administration.
Note that this script is intended for monolithic slapd.conf, not for config stored in LDAP tree. The latter one is to be edited with LDAP client, not with text editor.
